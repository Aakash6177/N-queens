# N-queens

This is a simple simulation of N-queen problems using two algorithms:

1) Genetic algorithms
2) Backtracking algorithm

Genetic algorithm: Genetic algorithms and backtracking are both search techniques used in computer science to find solutions to problems, but they operate in different ways

Backstracking algorithm: Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique used in computer science to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions through a recursive search. It is a brute-force approach that tries out different paths one by one until it finds a solution or determines that no solution exists.
